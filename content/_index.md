![me](profile-picture.jpg)

I'm an [Engineering Science](https://engsci.utoronto.ca/) student at the University of Toronto, majoring in Electrical and Computer Engineering.
My primary interests are in robotics, distributed systems, machine learning, and performance engineering.
In short, I like to build things that 1) work, 2) work well, and 3) work well together.

### What am I up to right now?
- Incoming @ Tesla Autopilot
- Building [kortex](https://www.kortex.co/)
- Research @ [TISL](https://tisl.cs.utoronto.ca/), co-supervised by NVIDIA research
- Trying to graduate :)


### Some things I've worked on in the past:
- ProdEng @ Uber
- Autopilot @ Tesla
- ROS & NASA [VIPER](https://www.nasa.gov/viper) lunar rover @ [Open Robotics](https://openrobotics.org/) (Now an Alphabet company)
- Accelerating machine learning on memristor crossbars @ [ISML](https://www.eecg.utoronto.ca/~roman/)
- Autonomous vehicles @ [aUToronto](https://www.autodrive.utoronto.ca/)
