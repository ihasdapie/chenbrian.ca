![me](profile-picture.jpg)

Hey, I'm Brian.

I studied [Engineering Science](https://engsci.utoronto.ca/) at the University of Toronto where I majored in Electrical and Computer Engineering.
Nowadays I spend my days working on Autopilot at Tesla.
My primary interests are in robotics, distributed systems, machine learning, optimization, and reliability.
In short, I like to build things that 1) work, 2) work well, and 3) work well together.

In the past, I've worked on:

- Building [kortex](https://www.kortex.co/)
- Research @ [TISL](https://tisl.cs.utoronto.ca/), co-supervised by NVIDIA research
- ProdEng @ Uber
- Autopilot @ Tesla
- ROS & NASA [VIPER](https://www.nasa.gov/viper) lunar rover @ [Open Robotics](https://openrobotics.org/) (Now an Alphabet company)
- Memristive ML Acceleration @ [ISML](https://www.eecg.utoronto.ca/~roman/)
- Autonomous vehicles @ [aUToronto](https://www.autodrive.utoronto.ca/)
