## The Jackdaw
[source](https://allpoetry.com/The-Jackdaw)


**William Cowper**   

There is a bird who, by his coat  
And by the hoarseness of his note,  
Might be supposed a crow;  
A great frequenter of the church,  
Where, bishop-like, he finds a perch,  
And dormitory too.  

Above the steeple shines a plate,  
That turns and turns, to indicate  
From what point blows the weather.  
Look up -- your brains begin to swim,  
'Tis in the clouds -- that pleases him,  
He chooses it the rather.   

Fond of the speculative height,  
Thither he wings his airy flight,  
And thence securely sees  
The bustle and the rareeshow,  
That occupy mankind below,  
Secure and at his ease.  

You think, no doubt, he sits and muses  
On future broken bones and bruises,  
If he should chance to fall.  
No; not a single thought like that  
Employs his philosophic pate,  
Or troubles it at all.  

He sees that this great roundabout,  
The world, with all its motley rout,  
Church, army, physic, law,  
Its customs and its businesses,  
Is no concern at all of his,  
And says -- what says he? -- Caw.  

Thrice happy bird! I too have seen  
Much of the vanities of men;  
And, sick of having seen 'em,  
Would cheerfully these limbs resign  
For such a pair of wings as thine  
And such a head between 'em.  


> There's something about the cadence and imagery here that makes this one so enthralling.





## Echolalia

**Ian Williams**  


Once one gets what one wants  
one no longer wants it.  


One no longer wants what?

 

One no longer wants what  
one wanted.

 
--

 
A man and a woman want a woman and a man  
or a man and a woman depending  
on the man and the woman.  

 

--

 

Once one gets what one wants once  
one no longer wants it once  


then one no longer wants it at all.

 

--

 

Yes then no. Yes and no? No.  
Yes then no then yes and always  
after yes comes no. Never always  
yes, but always no. Always know  
after yes comes no.  


--

 
One wants what one wants  
not what one wanted.  
  


## Ozymandias
[source](https://www.poetryfoundation.org/poems/46565/ozymandias)  

**Percy Shelley**  


I met a traveller from an antique land,  
Who said—“Two vast and trunkless legs of stone  
Stand in the desert. . . . Near them, on the sand,  
Half sunk a shattered visage lies, whose frown,  
And wrinkled lip, and sneer of cold command,  
Tell that its sculptor well those passions read  
Which yet survive, stamped on these lifeless things,  
The hand that mocked them, and the heart that fed;  
And on the pedestal, these words appear:  
My name is Ozymandias, King of Kings;  
Look on my Works, ye Mighty, and despair!  
Nothing beside remains. Round the decay  
Of that colossal Wreck, boundless and bare  
The lone and level sands stretch far away.”  


> Yes, this was also the title of the [legendary breaking bad episode](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt2301451/?ref_=tt_eps_top).  
> But where are his works? Ozymandias -- is now but two broken legs in the desert which "stretch far away". 

## Love
[source](https://www.poetryfoundation.org/poems/57416/love-56d23aec87f79)  
**Tina Chang**  

I am haunted by how much our mothers do not know.    
How a republic falls because of its backhanded deals,  
stairwell secrets. My mother does not know I am lying  
with a man who is darker than me, that we do not  
have names for how we truly treat our bodies.  
What we do with them. The other possesses me.  
Without him the perception of me fails to exist.  
My mother now is taking her sheers and cutting  
through live shrimp. When I was a child she peeled  
each flushed grape until only the pale fleshy bead  
remained. She placed them onto a plate in one shining  
mound, deseeded, in front of me. How I sucked and bled  
the fruit of all their juice, hypnotized in front of the buzz  
of television in each version of my childhood. I am  
her daughter. This is certain. I am lying down with a man  
who is darker than me and maybe this poem is my  
real republic, my face is my face, or is it stolen from  
my mother and hung over mine? If I were a dream  
you could say my countenance was a string of flickering lights  
made of teeth or an expression unraveling like a carpet  
into a narrow river of another life. Does truth matter  
when it's floating face up or face down?  
The answer to this makes all the difference.  

> I always get excited when I see Asian-{North American} representation/themes...





## The End of Landscape
[source](https://www.poetryfoundation.org/poems/55027/the-end-of-landscape)  
**Randall Mann**  

> This is just an excerpt from it I enjoyed

There's a certain sadness to this body of water  
adjacent to the runway, its reeds and weeds,  
handful of ducks, the water color  
 
manmade. A still life. And still  
life's a cold exercise in looking back,  
back to Florida, craning my neck  
 
like a sandhill crane in Alachua Basin.  
As for the scrub oaks,  
the hot wind in the leaves was language,  
 








## Vivas To Those Who Have Failed: The Paterson Silk Strike, 1913 
[source](https://www.poetryfoundation.org/poems/58738/vivas-to-those-who-have-failed-the-paterson-silk-strike-1913)  
**Martín Espada**  


Vivas to those who have fail'd!  
And to those whose war-vessels sank in the sea!  
And to those themselves who sank in the sea!  
And to all generals that lost engagements, and all overcome heroes!  
And the numberless unknown heroes equal to the greatest heroes known!  
—Walt Whitman  

*I. The Red Flag*  

The newspapers said the strikers would hoist  
the red flag of anarchy over the silk mills  
of Paterson. At the strike meeting, a dyers' helper  
from Naples rose as if from the steam of his labor,  
lifted up  his hand and said here is the red flag:  
brightly stained with dye for the silk of bow ties  
and scarves, the skin and fingernails boiled away  
for six dollars a week in the dye house.  

He sat down without another word, sank back  
into the fumes, name and face rubbed off  
by oblivion's thumb like a Roman coin  
from the earth of his birthplace dug up  
after a thousand years, as the strikers  
shouted the only praise he would ever hear.   

*II. The River Floods the Avenue*  

He was the other Valentino, not the romantic sheik  
and bullfighter of silent movie palaces who died too young,  
but the Valentino standing on his stoop to watch detectives  
hired by the company bully strikebreakers onto a trolley  
and a chorus of strikers bellowing the banned word scab.  
He was not a striker or a scab, but the bullet fired to scatter  
the crowd pulled the cork in the wine barrel of Valentino's back.  
His body, pale as the wings of a moth, lay beside his big-bellied wife.  

Two white-veiled horses pulled the carriage to the cemetery.  
Twenty thousand strikers walked behind the hearse, flooding  
the avenue like the river that lit up the mills, surging around  
the tombstones. Blood for blood, cried Tresca: at this signal,  
thousands of hands dropped red carnations and ribbons  
into the grave, till the coffin evaporated in a red sea.  

*III. The Insects in the Soup*  

Reed was a Harvard man. He wrote for the New York magazines.  
Big Bill, the organizer, fixed his good eye on Reed and told him  
of the strike. He stood on a tenement porch across from the mill  
to escape the rain and listen to the weavers. The bluecoats  
told him to move on. The Harvard man asked for a name to go  
with the number on the badge, and the cops tried to unscrew  
his arms from their sockets. When the judge asked his business,  
Reed said: Poet. The judge said: Twenty days in the county jail.  

Reed was a Harvard man. He taught the strikers Harvard songs,  
the tunes to sing with rebel words at the gates of the mill. The strikers  
taught him how to spot the insects in the soup, speaking in tongues  
the gospel of One Big Union and the eight-hour day, cramming the jail  
till the weary jailers had to unlock the doors. Reed would write:  
There's war in Paterson. After it was over, he rode with Pancho Villa.  

*IV. The Little Agitator*  

The cops on horseback charged into the picket line.  
The weavers raised their hands across their faces,  
hands that knew the loom as their fathers' hands  
knew the loom, and the billy clubs broke their fingers.  
Hannah was seventeen, the captain of the picket line,  
the Joan of Arc of the Silk Strike. The prosecutor called her  
a little agitator. Shame, said the judge; if she picketed again,  
he would ship her to the State Home for Girls in Trenton.  

Hannah left the courthouse to picket the mill. She chased  
a strikebreaker down the street, yelling in Yidish the word  
for shame. Back in court, she hissed at the judge's sentence  
of another striker. Hannah got twenty days in jail for hissing.  
She sang all the way to jail. After the strike came the blacklist,  
the counter at her husband's candy store, the words for shame.  

*V. Vivas to Those Who Have Failed*  

Strikers without shoes lose strikes. Twenty years after the weavers  
and dyers' helpers returned hollow-eyed to the loom and the steam,  
Mazziotti led the other silk mill workers marching down the avenue  
in Paterson, singing the old union songs for five cents more an hour.  
Once again the nightsticks cracked cheekbones like teacups.  
Mazziotti pressed both hands to his head, squeezing red ribbons  
from his scalp. There would be no buffalo nickel for an hour's work  
at the mill, for the silk of bow ties and scarves. Skull remembered wood.  

The brain thrown against the wall of the skull remembered too:  
the Sons of Italy, the Workmen's Circle, Local 152, Industrial  
Workers of the World, one-eyed Big Bill and Flynn the Rebel Girl  
speaking in tongues to thousands the prophecy of an eight-hour day.  
Mazziotti's son would become a doctor, his daughter a poet.  
Vivas to those who have failed: for they become the river.  




> __*"Vivas to those who have failed: for they become the river."*__  
> I like how this piece re-contextualizes the [1913 paterson silk strike](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1913_Paterson_silk_strike) as, well, not a failure because they stood up and lay the foundation for what's to come; they *became the river*. 
> In order to succeed one must go through a lot of failure.
> We take the 8-hour work day for granted now, but it definitely wasn't the case when this strike happened.
> The rights we enjoy today can be directly correlated with their actions and as such it is important for us to remember.
> Also the red imagery combined with all the stories [almost like a snapshot/diorama from the protest] is just so powerful.




## February Evening in New York 
[source](https://www.poetryfoundation.org/poems/42535/february-evening-in-new-york)  
**Denise Levertov**  
`As the stores close, a winter light`  
`opens air to iris blue,   `  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`glint of frost through the smoke  `  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`grains of mica, salt of the sidewalk.  `  
`As the buildings close, released autonomous     `  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`feet pattern the streets  `  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`in hurry and stroll; balloon heads  `  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`drift and dive above them; the bodies     `  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`aren't really there.  `  
`As the lights brighten, as the sky darkens,  `  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`a woman with crooked heels says to another woman     `  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`while they step along at a fair pace,  `  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*`"You know, I'm telling you, what I love best`*   
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*`is life. I love life! Even if I ever get  `*  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*`to be old and wheezy—or limp! You know?     `*  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*`Limping along?—I'd still ... "`* `Out of hearing.     `  
`To the multiple disordered tones  `  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`of gears changing, a dance  `  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`to the compass points, out, four-way river.     `  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`Prospect of sky  `  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`wedged into avenues, left at the ends of streets,     `  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`west sky, east sky: more life tonight! A range     `  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`of open time at winter's outskirts`  



> It's nice how I came across this poem the day after staying up late chatting with friends about art, music, and life.
> I suppose my own life choices in going off to Toronto to school is a little like going to my [Canadian] "New York": a place of opportunity and excitement and *where life happens*.
> "... and the bodies aren't really there...": it's easy to get caught up in the sea of people; others can seem like faceless balloon heads and to get lost.
> That's where good friends come in -- those late night talks over [homemade bubble tea](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=firTo7s_i9c) and leftover pasta have a wonderful effect.  
> _I love life_.  
> Also, there's some really wonderful use of meter [as pointed out by my roommate]; the stresses on `brighten` and `darken` in the 2nd stanza, the weird meter on `crooked heels`, and so on...



## Legacies
[source](https://www.poetryfoundation.org/poems/48227/legacies)  
**Nikki Giovanni**  


her grandmother called her from the playground     
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“yes, ma’am”  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“i want chu to learn how to make rolls” said the old       
woman proudly  
but the little girl didn’t want  
to learn how because she knew  
even if she couldn’t say it that  
that would mean when the old one died she would be less     
dependent on her spirit so  
she said  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“i don’t want to know how to make no rolls”  
with her lips poked out  
and the old woman wiped her hands on  
her apron saying “lord  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;these children”  
and neither of them ever  
said what they meant  
and i guess nobody ever does  


## At Sunset 
[source](https://www.poetryfoundation.org/poems/54036/at-sunset-56d233ed46e6e)  
**Jason Shinder**

Your death must be loved this much.  
 
You have to know the grief—now.  
Standing by the water’s edge,  
 
looking down at the wave  
 
touching you. You have to lie,  
stiff, arms folded, on a heap of earth  
 
and see how far the darkness  
 
will take you. I mean it, this, now—  
before the ghost the cold leaves  
 
in your breath, rises;  
 
before the toes are put together  
inside the shoes. There it is—the goddamn  
 
orange-going-into-rose descending  
 
circle of beauty and time.  
You have nothing to be sad about.  

## Hellonica (Excerpt)
Source: FreeBSD Fortunes 7 #473  
**Brian Aldiss**
When you are young, you enjoy a sustained illusion that sooner or later something marvelous is going to happen, that you are going to transcend your parents' limitations...
At the same time, you feel sure that in all the wilderness of possibility; in all the forests of opinion, there is a vital something that can be known -- known and grasped.
That we will eventually know it, and convert the whole mystery into a coherent narrative.
So that then one's true life -- the point of everything -- will emerge from the mist into a pure light, into total comprehension.
But it isn't like that at all.
But if it isn't, where did the idea come from, to torture and unsettle us?

## Moon
[Source](https://www.poetryfoundation.org/poetrymagazine/poems/55799/moon-56d237b984e78)
**Kathleen Jamie**

Last night, when the moon  
slipped into my attic room  
as an oblong of light,  
I sensed she’d come to commiserate.  

It was August. She traveled  
with a small valise  
of darkness, and the first few stars  
returning to the northern sky,  

and my room, it seemed,  
had missed her. She pretended  
an interest in the bookcase  
while other objects  

stirred, as in a rock pool,  
with unexpected life:  
strings of beads in their green bowl gleamed,  
the paper-crowded desk;  

the books, too, appeared inclined  
to open and confess.  
Being sure the moon  
harbored some intention,  

I waited; watched for an age  
her cool gaze shift  
first toward a flower sketch  
pinned on the far wall  

then glide down to recline  
along the pinewood floor,  
before I’d had enough. *Moon*,  
I said, *We’re both scarred now.*  

*Are they quite beyond you*,  
*the simple words of love? Say them.*  
*You are not my mother;*  
*with my mother, I waited unto death*.
