Let's face it -- \\( \LaTeX \\)) is *unequivocally cooler* than Word.
And you want an *unequivocally cool* resume.
So you tried [altacv](https://github.com/liantze/AltaCV), but it always got absolutely chewed up by ATS systems.

And so you *yearned* for a ðŸŒ coolðŸ¥¶ single-column layout, but you couldn't find one.  

I present: my [fork of altacv](https://github.com/ihasdapie/resume/) with a few ðŸŒŸ **revolutionary** ðŸŒŸ features.


1. Cut down on icons to improve pdf-to-text conversion
2. Change to a single-column layout
3. `\itag{asdf}` command to draw an inline "tag"
4. `\chref` command for hyperlinks
5. Disabling word wrapping and hyphenation
6. Various changes to `\makecvevent`, etc. to improve pdf-to-text conversion

For an example of the output, see my [resume](/resume.pdf), or the picture below.
